   * (6k - 1),(6k + 1) sequences up until square root of the input number (inclusive), as long as they are positive.
   *
   * The first number we need to check is 5 (6k - 1 => 6x1 - 1 => 5), followed by (6k + 1 => 6x1 + 1 => 7) and by doing the same operations for the next few numbers
   * we arrive at the following pattern: 5,7 -> 11,13 -> 17,19, etc...

   * <ol>
   *   <li>A check for primality for the 1st index and the 2nd (which is always +2 bigger than the 1st one), if possible</li>
   *   <li>After the 2 indexes from the previous point are checked and they are not prime, the index is incremented with 6 to reach the next sequence of interest</li>
   * </ol>
   *
   * All we need to do then is initialize the loop index at 5 and at each cycle get the current and the next number (which will be i + 2), check if the next number
   * does not exceed the sqrt and if any of them is a factor of the input - it's composite, otherwise we increment the i with 6 to jump to the next sequence we are interested in
   * and repeat the steps until a result is returned.
